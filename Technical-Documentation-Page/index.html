      <p>C++  is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.

It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, Web search or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes). C++ is a compiled language, with implementations of it available on many platforms. Many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM.</p>

<p>C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2017 as ISO/IEC 14882:2017 (informally known as C++17).[8] The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11 and C++14 standards. The current C++17 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979, as an extension of the C language as he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C, which also provided high-level features for program organization.[9] C++20 is the next planned standard thereafter.

Many other programming languages have been influenced by C++, including C#, D, Java, and newer versions of C.</p>

      <p>C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming. C++ is regarded as a middle-level language, as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features.</p>
      <p>C++ fully supports object-oriented programming, including the four pillars of object-oriented development : </p>
      <li>Encapsulation</li>
      <li>Data hiding</li>
      <li>Inheritance</li>
      <li>Polymorphism</li>

  <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world!">
    <header>Hello world!</header>
    <article> 
The “Hello World” program is the first step towards learning any programming language and also one of the simplest programs you will learn. All you have to do is display the message “Hello World” on the screen. Let us now look at the program:
<code>
//Simple C++ program to display "Hello World"
 
// Header file for input output functions
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
 
using namespace std;
 
// main function -
// where the execution of program begins
int main()
{
    // prints Hello World
    cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World";
     
    return 0;
}

</code>

Output :
  
  <code>
    Hello World
  </code>
  <p>Let us now examine every line of the above program :</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>// Simple C++ program to display “Hello World”</b> : This line is a comment line. A comment is used to display additional information about the program. Comment does not contain any programming logic. When a comment is encountered by a compiler, the compiler simply skips that line of code. Any line beginning with ‘//’ without quotes OR in between /*…*/ in C++ is  comment.</li>
      <li><b>#include </b>: In C++,  all lines that start with pound (#) sign are called directives and are processed by preprocessor which is a program invoked by the compiler. The #include directive tells the compiler to include a file and #include &lt;iostream&gt; . It tells the compiler to include the standard iostream file which contains declarations of all the standard input/output library functions.</li>
      <li><b>int main() </b>: This line is used to declare a function named “main” which returns data of integer type. A function is a group of statements that are designed to perform a specific task. Execution of every C++ program begins with the main() function, no matter where the function is located in the program. So, every C++ program must have a main() function.</li>
      <li><b>{ and }</b> : The opening braces ‘{‘ indicates the beginning of the main function and the closing braces ‘}’ indicates the ending of the main function. Every thing between these two comprises the body of the main function.</li>
      <li><b>std::cout&lt;&lt;“Hello World”; </b>:  This line tells the compiler to display the message “Hello Worlld” on the screen. This line is called a statement in C++. Every statement is meant to perform some task. A semi-colon ‘;’ is used to end a statement. Semi-colon character at the end of statement is used to indicate that the statement is ending there.
The std::cout is used to identify the standard character output device which is usually the desktop screen. Every thing followed by the character “&lt;&lt;” is displayed to the output device.</li>
      <li><b>return 0;</b> : This is also a statement. This statement is used to return a value from a function and indicates the finishing of a function. This statement is basically used in functions to return the results of the operations performed by a function.</li>
      <li><b>Indentation </b>: As you can see the cout and the return statement have been indented or moved to the right side. This is done to make the code more readable. In a program as Hello World, it does not hold much relevance seems but as the programs become more complex, it makes the code more readable, less error prone. Therefore, you must always use indentations and comments to make the code more readable</li>

    <header>Variables</header>
    <article>
    <p>
A variable provides us with named storage that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C++ has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.

The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C++ is case-sensitive −

There are following basic types of variable in C++ :
    </p>
   <ol>
     <li><b>bool</b><br> Boolean data type is used for storing boolean or logical values. A boolean variable can store either true or false.</li>
     <li><b>char</b><br> Character data type is used for storing characters. Keyword used for character data type is char. Characters typically requires 1 byte of memory space and ranges from -128 to 127 or 0 to 255.</li>
     <li><b>int</b><br>  Keyword used for integer data types is int. Integers typically requires 4 bytes of memory space and ranges from -2147483648 to 2147483647</li>
     <li><b>float</b><br> Floating Point data type is used for storing single precision floating point values or decimal values. Float variables typically requires 4 byte of memory space.</li>
     <li><b>double</b><br> Double Floating Point data type is used for storing double precision floating point values or decimal values. Double variables typically requires 8 byte of memory space.</li>
     <li><b>void</b><br> Void means without any value. void datatype represents a valueless entity. Void data type is used for those function which does not returns a value.</li>
     <li><b>wchar_t</b><br> Wide character data type is also a character data type but this data type has size greater than the normal 8-bit datatype. It is generally 2 or 4 bytes long.</li>
    </ol>

    <header>Declaring variables</header>
    <article>
<p>A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there is one variable existing with the given type and name so that compiler proceed for further compilation without needing complete detail about the variable. A variable declaration has its meaning at the time of compilation only, compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking of the program.</p>
      <p>A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use extern keyword to declare a variable at any place. Although you can declare a variable multiple times in your C++ program, but it can be defined only once in a file, a function or a block of code.</p>
      <p><b>Example:</b></p>
      <code>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

// Variable declaration:
extern int a, b;
extern int c;
extern float f;
  
int main () {
   // Variable definition:
   int a, b;
   int c;
   float f;
 
   // actual initialization
   a = 10;
   b = 20;
   c = a + b;
 
   cout &lt;&lt; c &lt;&lt; endl ;

   f = 70.0/3.0;
   cout &lt;&lt; f &lt;&lt; endl ;
 
   return 0;
}
        </code>
        <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result: </p>
        <code>
    30
    23.3333
        </code>
        <p>Same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example: </p>
        <code>
// function declaration
int func();
int main() {
   // function call
   int i = func();
}

// function definition
int func() {
   return 0;
}

  <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
    <header>Variable scope</header>
    <article>
     <p>In general, scope is defined as the extent upto which something can be worked with. In programming also scope of a variable is defined as the extent of the program code within which the variable can we accessed or declared or worked with. There are mainly two types of variable scopes as discussed below:</p>
      <p><b>Local Variables</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Anything between ‘{‘ and ‘}’ is said to be inside a block</li>
        <li>Local variables do not exist outside of the block in which they are declared, i.e. they can not be accessed or used outside of that block.</li>
        <li><b>Declaring local variables :</b> Local variables are declared inside a block</li>
      </ul>
    <code> 
// CPP program to illustrate 
// usage of local variables 
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
 
void func()
{   
    // this variable is local to the
    // function func() and cannot be 
    // accessed outside this function
    int age=18;    
}
 
int main()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "Age is: " &lt;&lt; age;
     
    return 0;
}
        </code>

      <p>Output : </p>
      <code>
        Error: age was not declared in this scope
      </code>
      <p>The above program displays an error saying “age was not declared in this scope”. The variable age was declared within the function func() so it is local to that function and not visible to portion of program outside this function.
        <br><br><b>Rectified Program</b> : To correct the above error we have to display the value of variable age from the function func() only. This is shown in the below program :</P>
    <code>
 // CPP program to illustrate 
// usage of local variables 
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
 
void func()
{   
    // this variable is local to the
    // function func() and cannot be 
    // accessed outside this function
    int age=18; 
    cout &lt;&lt; age;
}
 
int main()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "Age is: ";
    func();
     
    return 0;
}
      </code>
      <p> Output : </p>
      <code>

  <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
    <header>Global variables</header>
    <article>
<p>As the name suggests, Global Variables can be accessed from any part of the program.</p>

<ul>
  <li>They are available through out the life time of a program.</li>
  <li>They are declared at the top of the program outside all of the functions or blocks.</li>
  <li><b>Declaring global variables </b>: Global variables are usually declared outside of all of the functions and blocks, at the top of the program. They can be accessed from any portion of the program.</li>
      </ul>
      <code>
// CPP program to illustrate 
// usage of global variables 
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
 
// global variable
int global = 5;
 
// global variable accessed from
// within a function
void display()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; global &lt;&lt; endl; 
}
 
// main function
int main()
{
    display();
     
    // changing value of global
    // variable from main function
    global = 10;
    display();
}
        </code>
      <p>Output: </p>
      <code>
 5
10
      </code>
      <p>In the program, the variable “global” is declared at the top of the program outside all of the functions so it is a global variable and can be accessed or updated from anywhere in the program.</p>
      
      <p>What if there exists a local variable with the same name as that of global variable inside a function?</p>
      
      <p>Let us repeat the question once again. The question is : if there is a variable inside a function with the same name as that of a global variable and if the function tries to access the variable with that name, then which variable will be given precedence? Local variable or Global variable? Look at the below program to understand the question :</p>
      <code>
// CPP program to illustrate 
// scope of local variables 
// and global variables together
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
 
// global variable
int global = 5;
 
// main function
int main()
{   
    // local variable with same 
    // name as that of global variable
     
    int global = 2;
    cout &lt;&lt; global &lt;&lt; endl;
}
        </code>
        <p>Look at the above program. The variable “global” declared at the top is global and stores the value 5 where as that declared within main function is local and stores a value 2. So, the question is when the value stored in the variable named “global” is printed from the main function then what will be the output? 2 or 5?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Usually when two variable with same name are defined then the compiler produces a compile time error. But if the variables are defined in different scopes then the compiler allows it.</li>
          <li>Whenever there is a local variable defined with same name as that of a global variable then the compiler will give precedence to the local variable</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here in the above program also, the local variable named “global” is given precedence. So the output is 2.</p>
        <p>How to access a global variable when there is a local variable with same name?</p>
        <p>What if we want to do the opposite of above task. What if we want to access global variable when there is a local variable with same name?
To solve this problem we will need to use the scope resolution operator. Below program explains how to do this with the help of scope resolution operator.</p>
        <code>
// C++ program to show that we can access a global 
// variable using scope resolution operator :: when  
// there is a local variable with same name 
#include &lt;iostream&gt; 
using namespace std;
  
// Global x  
int x = 0;  
   
int main()
{
  // Local x    
  int x = 10; 
  cout &lt;&lt; "Value of global x is " &lt;&lt; ::x;
  cout &lt;&lt; "\nValue of local x is " &lt;&lt; x;  
  return 0;
}
          </code>
          <p>Output :</p>
          <code>
Value of global x is 0
Value of local x is 10

  <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
    <header>Constants</header>
    <article>
<p>Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter and they are called literals.

Constants can be of any of the basic data types and can be divided into Integer Numerals, Floating-Point Numerals, Characters, Strings and Boolean Values.

Again, constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.</p>
      <p>Defining Constants</p>
      <p>There are two simple ways in C++ to define constants : </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using <b>#define</b> preprocessor.</li>
        <li>Using <b>const</b> keyword.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Following is the form to use #define preprocessor to define a constant</p>
      <code>
#define identifier value
      </code>
      <p>The following example explains it in detail:</p>
      <code>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

#define LENGTH 10   
#define WIDTH  5
#define NEWLINE '\n'

int main() {
   int area;  
   
   area = LENGTH * WIDTH;
   cout &lt;&lt; area;
   cout &lt;&lt; NEWLINE;
   return 0;
}
        </code>
        <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:</p>
        <code>
  50
        </code>
        <p>You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type as follows</p>
        <code>
          const type variable = value;
        </code>
        <p>Following example explains it in detail</p>
        <code>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() {
   const int  LENGTH = 10;
   const int  WIDTH  = 5;
   const char NEWLINE = '\n';
   int area;  
   
   area = LENGTH * WIDTH;
   cout &lt;&lt; area;
   cout &lt;&lt; NEWLINE;
   return 0;
}
          </code>
          <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result</p>
          <code>
  50
          </code>
          <p>Note that it is a good programming practice to define constants in CAPITALS</p>

    <header>if...else statements</header>
    <article>
<p>The if statement evaluates the test expression inside parenthesis.

If test expression is evaluated to true, statements inside the body of the if statement are executed.

If test expression is evaluated to false, statements inside the body of the if statement are skipped.</p>
      <code>
if (testExpression) 
{
   // statements
}
      </code>
      <p> Here is an example of an if statement executing code: </p>
      <code>
// Program to print positive number entered by the user
// If user enters negative number, it is skipped

    }

    cout &lt;&lt; "This statement is always executed.";

        <code>
Enter a number: -5
This statement is always executed.
        </code>
        <p> if...else</p>
        <p>The if else statement executes the code inside the body of the if statement if the test expression is true and skips the code inside the body of the else statement.

If the test expression is false, it executes the code inside the body of the else statement and skips the code inside the body of the if statement.</p>
        <code>
// Program to check whether an integer is positive or negative
// This program considers 0 as positive number

          <p>C++ Nested if...else</p>
          <p>The if...else statement executes two different codes depending upon whether the test expression is true or false. Sometimes, a choice has to be made from more than 2 possibilities.

The nested if...else statement allows you to check for multiple test expressions and execute different codes for more than two conditions.</p>
          <p>Syntax of Nested if...else</p>
          <code>
if (testExpression1) 
{
   // statements to be executed if testExpression1 is true
}
else if(testExpression2) 
{
   // statements to be executed if testExpression1 is false and testExpression2 is true
}
else if (testExpression 3) 
{
   // statements to be executed if testExpression1 and testExpression2 is false and testExpression3 is true

.
.
else 
{
   // statements to be executed if all test expressions are false

if ( a &lt; b ) {
   a = b;
}
else {
   a = -b;
}
          </code>
        <p>You can replace the above code with:</p>
        <code>
a = (a &lt; b) ? b : -b;
           </code>
      <p>The ternary operator is more readable and practical than a if...else statement for short conditions.</p>

<p>In computer programming, loop repeats a certain block of code until some end condition is met.

  There are 3 type of loops in C++ Programming :</p>
      <ul>
        <li>for Loop</li>
        <li>while Loop</li>
        <li>do... while Loop</li>
      </ul>
      <p>for Loop</p>
      <p>The syntax for a for Loop is :</p>
      <code>
for(initializationStatement; testExpression; updateStatement) {
    // code
}   
      </code>
      <p>where, only the test expression is mandatory.</p>
      <p>How a for loop works?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The initialization statement is executed only once at the beginning.</li>
        <li>Then, the test expression is evaluated.</li>
        <li>If the test expression is false, for loop is terminated. But if the test expression is true, the code inside the body of the for loop is executed and the update expression is updated.</li>
        <li>Again, the test expression is evaluated and this process repeats itself until the test expression is false.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Example with code: </p>
      <code>
// C++ Program to find factorial of a number
// Factorial on n = 1*2*3*...*n

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() 
{
    int i, n, factorial = 1;

    cout &lt;&lt; "Enter a positive integer: ";
    cin >> n;

    for (i = 1; i &lt;= n; ++i) {
        factorial *= i;   // factorial = factorial * i;
    }

    cout &lt;&lt; "Factorial of " &lt;&lt; n &lt;&lt;" = " &lt;&lt;factorial;
    return 0;
}
                                                </code>
      <p> Output: </p>
      <code>
Enter a positive integer: 5
Factorial of 5 = 120
      </code>
      <p>In the program, the user is asked to enter a positive integer which is stored in variable n (suppose user entered 5). Here is the process of the for loop:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Initially, i is equal to 1, test expression is true, factorial becomes 1.</li>
        <li>i is updated to 2, test expression is true, factorial becomes 2.</li>
        <li>i is updated to 3, test expression is true, factorial becomes 6.</li>
        <li>i is updated to 4, test expression is true, factorial becomes 24.</li>
        <li>i is updated to 5, test expression is true, factorial becomes 120.</li>
        <li>i is updated to 6, test expression is false, for loop is terminated.</li>
      </ol>
        <p>In the above program, variable i is not used outside of the for loop. In such cases, it is better to declare the variable in for loop (at initialization statement) as seen in the code below.</p>
      <code>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() 
{
    int n, factorial = 1;

    cout &lt;&lt; "Enter a positive integer: ";
    cin >> n;

    for (int i = 1; i &lt;= n; ++i) {
        factorial *= i;   // factorial = factorial * i;
    }

    cout &lt;&lt; "Factorial of " &lt;&lt; n &lt;&lt;" = " &lt;&lt; factorial;
    return 0;
} 
      </code>
      
      <p>while Loop<p>
      <p>The syntax for a while Loop is : </p>
      <code>
while (testExpression) 
{
     // code  
}
      </code>
      <p>where, testExpression is checked on each entry of the while loop.
      </p><p>How while loop works?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The while loop evaluates the test expression.</li>
        <li>If the test expression is true, the code inside the body of while loop is evaluated.</li>
        <li>Then, the test expression is evaluated again. This process goes on until the test expression is false.</li>
        <li>Once the test expression is false, the while loop is terminated.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> while Loop example: </p>
      <code>
// C++ Program to compute factorial of a number
// Factorial of n = 1*2*3...*n

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() 
{
    int number, i = 1, factorial = 1;

    cout &lt;&lt; "Enter a positive integer: ";
    cin >> number;
    
    while ( i &lt;= number) {
        factorial *= i;      //factorial = factorial * i;
        ++i;
    }

    cout &lt;&lt; "Factorial of "&lt;&lt; number &lt;&lt;" = "&lt;&lt; factorial;
    return 0;
}
                                                      </code>
      <p> Output: </p>
      <code>
Enter a positive integer: 4
Factorial of 4 = 24
      </code>
      <p>In this program, user is asked to enter a positive integer which is stored in variable number. Let's suppose, user entered 4.

      </p><p>Then, the while loop starts executing the code. Here's how while loop works:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Initially, i = 1, test expression i &lt;= number is true and factorial becomes 1.</li>
        <li>Variable i is updated to 2, test expression is true, factorial becomes 2.</li>
        <li>Variable i is updated to 3, test expression is true, factorial becomes 6.</li>
        <li>Variable i is updated to 4, test expression is true, factorial becomes 24.</li>
        <li>Variable i is updated to 5, test expression is false and while loop is terminated.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <p>do...while Loop</p>
      <p>The do...while loop is a variant of the while loop with one important difference. The body of do...while loop is executed once before the test expression is checked.

      </p><p>The syntax of do..while loop is:</p>
      <code>
do {
   // code;
}
while (testExpression);
      </code>
      <p>How do...while loop works?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The code inside the body of the loop is executed at least once. Then, only the test expression is checked.</li>
        <li>If the test expression is true, the body of the loop is executed. This process continues until the test expression becomes false.</li>
        <li>Once the test expression is false, the do...while loop is terminated.</li>
        </ul>
      <p> do...while Loop example: </p>
      <code>
// C++ program to add numbers until user enters 0

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() 
{
    float number, sum = 0.0;
    
    do {
        cout &lt;&lt; "Enter a number: ";
        cin>>number;
        sum += number;
    }
    while(number != 0.0);

    cout &lt;&lt; "Total sum = " &lt;&lt; sum;
    
    return 0;
}
      </code>
      <p>Output : </p>
      <code>
Enter a number: 2
Enter a number: 3
Enter a number: 4
Enter a number: -4
Enter a number: 2
Enter a number: 4.4
Enter a number: 2
Enter a number: 0

  <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
    <header>Function declarations</header>
    <article> 
<p>A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C++ program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.

      </p><p>You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division usually is such that each function performs a specific task.

      </p><p>A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.

      </p><p>The C++ standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, function strcat() to concatenate two strings, function memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location and many more functions.

      </p><p>A function is known with various names like a method or a sub-routine or a procedure etc.</p>
      <p> Defining a Function</p>
      <p>The general form of a C++ function definition is as follows</p>
      <code>
return_type function_name( parameter list ) {
   body of the function
}
      </code>
      <p>A C++ function definition consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Return Type</b> − A function may return a value. The return_type is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword void.</li>
        <li><b>Function Name</b> − This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.</li>
        <li><b>Parameters</b> − A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.</li>
        <li><b>Function Body</b> − The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Example: </p><p>
Following is the source code for a function called max(). This function takes two parameters num1 and num2 and return the biggest of both </p>
      <code>
// function returning the max between two numbers
 
int max(int num1, int num2) {
   // local variable declaration
   int result;
 
   if (num1 > num2)
      result = num1;
   else
      result = num2;
 
   return result; 
}
      </code>
      <p>Function Declarations</p><p>
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.

      </p><p>A function declaration has the following attributes:</p>
      <code>
return_type function_name( parameter list );
      </code>
      <p>For the above defined function max(), following is the function declaration:</p>
      <code>
int max(int num1, int num2);
      </code>
      <p>Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so following is also valid declaration: </p>
      <code>
int max(int, int);
      </code>
      <p>Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such a case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Calling a Function</p>
      <p>While creating a C++ function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call or invoke that function.</p><p>

When a program calls a function, program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs a defined task and when it’s return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns program control back to the main program.</p><p>

To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with function name, and if function returns a value, then you can store returned value. For example:</p>
      <code>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
 
// function declaration
int max(int num1, int num2);
 
int main () {
   // local variable declaration:
   int a = 100;
   int b = 200;
   int ret;
 
   // calling a function to get max value.
   ret = max(a, b);
   cout &lt;&lt; "Max value is : " &lt;&lt; ret &lt;&lt; endl;
 
   return 0;
}
 
// function returning the max between two numbers
int max(int num1, int num2) {
   // local variable declaration
   int result;
 
   if (num1 > num2)
      result = num1;
   else
      result = num2;
 
   return result; 
}
        </code>
      <p>I kept max() function along with main() function and compiled the source code. After running the final execution, it would produce the following result: </p>
      <code>
 Max value is : 200
      </code>
      <p>Function Arguments<p>
      <p>If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.</p><p>

The formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.</p><p>
      
      By default, C++ uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, this means that code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function and above mentioned example while calling max() function used the same method.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Default Values for Parameters</p>
      <p>When you define a function, you can specify a default value for each of the last parameters. This value will be used if the corresponding argument is left blank when calling to the function.</p><p>

This is done by using the assignment operator and assigning values for the arguments in the function definition. If a value for that parameter is not passed when the function is called, the default given value is used, but if a value is specified, this default value is ignored and the passed value is used instead. Consider the following example:</p>
      <code>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
 
int sum(int a, int b = 20) {
   int result;
   result = a + b;
  
   return (result);
}
int main () {
   // local variable declaration:
   int a = 100;
   int b = 200;
   int result;
 
   // calling a function to add the values.
   result = sum(a, b);
   cout &lt;&lt; "Total value is :" &lt;&lt; result &lt;&lt; endl;

   // calling a function again as follows.
   result = sum(a);
   cout &lt;&lt; "Total value is :" &lt;&lt; result &lt;&lt; endl;
 
   return 0;
}
      </code>
        <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:</p>
        <code>
Total value is :300
Total value is :120
        </code>
