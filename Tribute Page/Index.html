    <h2 class="text-center"style="margin-top:60px">Here's a short time line of Michael Collins Life and his role in shaping the Irish Nation:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>1890:</b> Born in Sam's Cross, County Cork on the 12th of October. Michael Collins was youngest of eight children. He would go on to become a revolutionary leader, politician, Minister for Finance, Director of Secret Inteligence, TD for Cork and the First Irish Government, Director of Arms for the IRA, President of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Republican_Brotherhood"target="_blank">Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB)</a> until his death and the commander-in-chief of the National Army.</li> 
      <li><b>1906:</b> Passed the British Civil Service examination after leaving school at fiteen and moved to London to work in the Post Office Savings Bank in Blythe House. Collins was described in a British Secret Service report as <em>"brainy"</em> and his family belonged to an ancient clan of County Cork with strong Repubnlican links to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Rebellion_of_1798"target="_blank">1796 rebellion</a>.</li>
      <li><b>1909:</b> Joined the IRB through contacts in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_GAA"target="_blank">London GAA</a>.
      <li><b>1910:</b> Became a messenger at a London stockbrokers firm and studied law at King's College London.</li>
      <li><b>1916:</b> Returned to Ireland and was appointed financial advisor to Count Plunkett. Joined the Irish volunteers and took part in preparing arms and drilling troops for the 1916 Easter Rebellion. Was later arrested and imprisoned in Frongoch internment camp in Wales.</li>

      <div class="caption text-center" style="margin-bottom:50px">Britain's reaction to execute these political prisoners rallied national pride amongst the Irish and lead to the Independance of the Irish Republic and to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_War_of_Independence"target="_blank"><em>war of Independence</em></a></div>
      <li><b>1917:</b> After his release from prison, Collins became the <em>Secretary to the National Aid and Volunteers Dependents Fund (NAVDF)</em> and became deeply rooted in Irish secret intelligence.</li>
      <li><b>1919:</b> Eamon de Valera, President of the Sinn Fein political party appointed Michael Collins as the new Minister for Finance. Operating in secret to avoid prosecution and murder by the British Government, Collins produced a Finance Ministry capable of organising <em>National loans</em> to fund the new Irish Republic.</li>
      <li><b>1920:</b> After repeated succesful guerilla warfare attacks on british troops, the Brtitish offered a bounty of £10,000 for information leading to Collins capture or death. The crown sent newly formed special forces such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_and_Tans"target="_blank"><em>Black and Tans</em><a> to enforce their reign of terror on the irish people. After Collins and his secret service 'squad' assassinated 19 British secret service agents a.k.a <em>"The Cairo Gang"</em>, members of the Royal Irish Constabulary interupted a G.A.A footbal match in Croke park and opened fire on the crowd. This day was forvevr remembered as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Sunday_(1920)"target="_blank"><em>Bloody Sunday.</em></a></li>
        <li><b>1921:</b> By July the British Governemnt sought a ceasefire, however General MacReady, commander of British forces in Ireland, claimed that the only hope of the British Empire's control over Ireland would be martial law. Britain's efforts at a millitary solution only spawned a powerful peace movement, demanding an end to slaughter in Ireland. The Irish gained much support through Irish-American public opinion and even the Pope appealed for negotiations. President de Valera insisted Michael Collins represent the Irish Republic in peace negotiations in London. The negotiations would soon lead to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Irish_Treaty"target="_blank"><em>Anglo-Irish Treaty.</em></a></li>

        <li style="margin-top:60px"><b>1922:</B> The signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty saw Ireland become an independent Republic Nation however, the 6 northern counties heavilly populated with British protestants remained under British rule. This split the Irish government and military in two and led to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Civil_War"target="_blank"><em>Irish Civil War</em></a>.Violence erupted in Northern Ireland as the notorious <em>'Specials'</em> (a force of ameture and retired British soldiers) terrorised and murdered northern catholics. Churchill sent armed forces into the north and Collins retaliated by sending IRA units and money to the borderlands for more geurilla warfare.</li>

        <p>  There is much controversy and conspiracy surrounding the death of Michael Collins. The only witnesses were free state soldiers in his convey and anti-treaty IRA ambushers. No two witness statements match and nearly all statements are contradictory. No witnesses were ever questioned by authorities leading all accounts of the day in question to be passed down through newspapers, biographies, private documents and word of mouth. A common theory is that de Velera had Michael Collins assassinated however one account claims Collins was on route to meet de Velera to discuss peace talks. Michael Collins plan to visit Cork was strongly advised against by his trusted associates as Cork was an IRA stronghold. Collins was spotted by an IRA sentry at Béal na Bláth, an isolated crossroads and an ambush was laid for his return trip. Collins later suffered a head wound in the ambush and was the only fatality in the attack. Most the details of the attack were disputed amongst all witnesses and many questions have been raised about handling of Collins's remains immediately following his death. Documents he was sure to have been carrying were never recovered and it would be decades before his field journal truned up.</p>
        <p>
          Medical evidence is also insufficient. The precise nature of his wounds and death were never recorded and there was never an autopsy report, leading to speculation as to which doctor performed the autopsy and if there ever was an autopsy in the first place. Irish writers such as <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7374948.S_M_Sigerson"target="_blank"><em>S.M. Sigerson</em></a> have extensively researched the life and death of Michael Collins and call for a full forensic examination of Collins's remains in order to settle some of the controversies concerning his death.</p>
