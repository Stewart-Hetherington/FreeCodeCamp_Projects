This is the very first project I designed using CSS and html. The project was designed as a tribute page to Michael Collins, as an excercise to develop my understanding of CSS and html. The project was mostly designed on CodePen as instructed by FreeCodeCamp however, adjustments were later made externally as webpages don't always appear the same outside of CodePen
