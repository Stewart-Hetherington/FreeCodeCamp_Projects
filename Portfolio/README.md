This project was the second project requested by FreeCodeCamp and is a simple portfolio page made using CSS and Html. There are four links to my other profiles and some basic contact information. Nothing too fancy but hopefully I will be able to beef it up with more projects and greater coding experience later on. Again, I used CodePen while building this project and once again ran into complications when viewing the html code externally. I may be inclined to not use CodePen in the future.
