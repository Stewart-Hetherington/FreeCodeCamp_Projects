    <P>My name is Stewart Hetherington and I am currently in my final year at the National University of Ireland Maynooth.
	    I am studying chinese and computer science for my international BA. I have already spent one year in Wuhan University
	    and spent another living in Shanghai atteneding Shanghai University. I'm currently studying java and have a good
	    understanding of data structures and algorithms. I have started studying html5, CSS and javascript on freeCodeCamp in
	    my spare time and hope to become a full stack web developer. As of now I hold a HSK4 cetificate making me officially 
	    fluent in Chinese, however my goal is to become completely fluent in the next three years, and work in Shanghai.
