This is my first project in which I used javascript. The task was to create a simple random quote generator,
so I decided to use quotes from my favourite cartoons. After finding this too easy, I decided to add a changing background
depending on what quote appeared. All thats left to do is to incorporate a tweet button to retweet quotes from the page.
